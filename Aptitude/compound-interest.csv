1,Simple interest on a certain sum of money for 3 years at 8% per annum is half the compound interest on Rs. 4000 for 2 years at 10% per annum. The sum placed on simple interest is:,Rs. 1550,Rs. 1650,Rs. 1750,Rs. 2000,C,C.I.= Rs.4000 x1 +102- 4000100= Rs.4000 x11x11- 40001010= Rs. 840.Sum = Rs.420 x 100= Rs. 1750.3 x 8,compound-interest
2,"If the simple interest on a sum of money for 2 years at 5% per annum is Rs. 50, what is the compound interest on the same at the same rate and for the same time?",Rs. 51.25,Rs. 52,Rs. 54.25,Rs. 60,A,Sum = Rs.50 x 100= Rs. 500.2 x 5Amount= Rs.500 x1 +52100= Rs.500 x21x212020= Rs. 551.25C.I. = Rs. (551.25 - 500) = Rs. 51.25,compound-interest
3,The difference between simple interest and compound on Rs. 1200 for one year at 10% per annum reckoned half-yearly is:,Rs. 2.50,Rs. 3,Rs. 3.75,Rs. 4,B,S.I. = Rs1200 x 10 x 1= Rs. 120.100C.I. = Rs.1200 x1 +52- 1200= Rs. 123.100Difference = Rs. (123 - 120) = Rs. 3.,compound-interest
4,"The difference between compound interest and simple interest on an amount of Rs. 15,000 for 2 years is Rs. 96. What is the rate of interest per annum?",8,10,12,Cannot be determined,A,15000 x1 +R2- 15000-15000 x R x 2= 96100100150001 +R2- 1 -2R= 9610010015000(100 + R)2- 10000 - (200 x R)= 9610000R2=96 x 2= 643R = 8.Rate = 8%.,compound-interest
5,The compound interest on a certain sum for 2 years at 10% per annum is Rs. 525. The simple interest on the same sum for double the time at half the rate percent per annum is:,Rs. 400,Rs. 500,Rs. 600,Rs. 800,B,"Let the sum be Rs. P.Then,P1 +102- P= 525100P112- 1= 52510P =525 x 100= 2500.21Sum = Rs . 2500.So, S.I. = Rs.2500 x 5 x 4= Rs. 500100",compound-interest
