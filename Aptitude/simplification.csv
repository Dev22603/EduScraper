1,"In a regular week, there are 5 working days and for each day, the working hours are 8. A man gets Rs. 2.40 per hour for regular work and Rs. 3.20 per hours for overtime. If he earns Rs. 432 in 4 weeks, then how many hours does he work for ?",160,175,180,195,B,"Suppose the man works overtime forxhours.Now, working hours in 4 weeks = (5 x 8 x 4) = 160.160 x 2.40 +xx 3.20 = 4323.20x= 432 - 384 = 48x= 15.Hence, total hours of work = (160 + 15) = 175.",simplification

At the same time, Albert gets on an elevator at the 51st floor of the same building and rides down at the rate of 63 floors per minute. If they continue travelling at these rates, then at which floor will their paths cross ?",19,28,30,37,C,"Suppose their paths cross afterxminutes.Then, 11 + 57x= 51 - 63x120x= 40x =13Number of floors covered by David in (1/3) min. =1x 57= 19.3So, their paths cross at (11 +19)i.e.,30thfloor.",simplification
