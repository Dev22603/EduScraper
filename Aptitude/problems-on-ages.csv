4,"Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. If the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years, what is definitely the difference between R and Q's age?",1 year,2 years,25 years,Data inadequate,D,"Given that:1. The difference of age b/w R and Q = The difference of age b/w Q and T.2. Sum of age of R and T is 50 i.e. (R + T) = 50.Question: R - Q = ?.Explanation:R - Q = Q - T(R + T) = 2QNow given that, (R + T) = 50So, 50 = 2Q and therefore Q = 25.Question is (R - Q) = ?Here we know the value(age) of Q (25), but we don't know the age of R.Therefore, (R-Q) cannot be determined.",problems-on-ages
